Hi .NET Desktop Developer,

this module starts where the previous module has ended. 

That means you find the starter demo for this module in the previous module's "after"-folder.

If you have any questions, please ask those questions in the discussion tab on the homepage of this course at www.pluralsight.com.

Thank you,
Thomas Claudius Huber
