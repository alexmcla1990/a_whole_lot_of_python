#ord method to convert a charcter to its numeric representation in unicode
#Just like how we could convert a character into its numeric Unicode using ord() method, we do the inverse i.e., 
find the character represented by a number using chr() method.
The chr() method accepts a number representing the Unicode of a character and returns the actual character 
corresponding to the numeric code.
