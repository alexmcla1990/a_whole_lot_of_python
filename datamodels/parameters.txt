XGboost parameters
over fit/under fit

max_depth: how many levels the model is allowed to grow. 2-30ish
if you increase maximum depth you may overfit the model
subsample: 0-1 = 100% of data
colsample by level: 0-1 for every level, percentage of data (.5 = 50% of data)
colsample by tree: 0-1 for every tree, percentage of data 

SS, CBL, CBT : regularization

min child weight: 1, 5, 100, regularizes with increase
lambda: when increase, regularization
alpha: when increase, regularization

n estimator: number of trees, boosting eachother, default value is 100, increase will effect training speed 
learning rate: percentage of residual and add it back to boosting tree, if you increase learning rate too heavily will not give you proper results. keep learning rate small. 
.01 - .5 or .8 if you're crazy, can go beyond 1 if you are a wild person
